so today I completed 2 tasks:
1. gave 1 contest today and went for a problem just outside of my comfort zone
2. so for starting q# I need to study the microsoft blogs which I have bookmarked and then after completing the tutorial I will move on to solve the q# challenges.
rest It was a okayish day, from now on I need to avoid some toxic people from my school.
